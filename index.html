        <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the
        shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.
        
        Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as
        viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western
        horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright
        star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete
        range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its
        synodic period of approximately 116 days.
        
        Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit
        resonance,[16] meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two
        revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][17] As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital
        motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one
        day every two Mercurian years.
        
        Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about ​1⁄30 degree). Its orbital eccentricity
        is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;[b] at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about
        two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance
        to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to
        retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging
        from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.[18] The
        polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no known natural satellites.
        
        Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited
        Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30,
        2015.[19][20][21] The BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025.</p>
        <li><h1 id="venus">Venus</h1></li>
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the second-brightest
        natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the
        naked eye in broad daylight.[15][16] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun,
        either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7
        Earth days.[17] With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet
        in the Solar System and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets
        in the east).[18] Venus does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar
        System.[19]
        
        Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass,
        proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest
        atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the
        planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is
        by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), even though
        Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid,
        preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past,[20][21]
        but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect.[22] The water has probably
        photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack
        of a planetary magnetic field.[23] Venus's surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and is
        periodically resurfaced by volcanism.
        
        As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have
        existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the
        morning star and evening star. Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the
        second millennium BC.[24]
        
        As the planet with the closest approach to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It
        was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully landed
        on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the
        first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for
        rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.
        
        In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence that suggests that Venus is currently volcanically active.[25][26]</p>
        <li><h1 id="earth">Earth</h1></li>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric
        dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other
        objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun
        in 365.256 solar days, a period known as an Earth sidereal year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis 366.256
        times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal days.[n 6]
        
        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational
        interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its
        rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.
        
        Earth's outer layer (lithosphere) is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over
        many millions of years. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is
        covered with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which all together constitute the
        hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice
        of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates
        Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
        
        Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere
        and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates
        that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the
        Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth,
        biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all
        species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most
        species have not been described. Over 7.7 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural</p>
        <li><h1 id="mars">Mars</h1></li>
        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being only larger than
        Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".[16][17]
        The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
        distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[18] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
        atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice
        caps of Earth.
        
        The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the
        rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and
        highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the
        Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact
        feature.[19][20] Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured
        asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.[21][22]
        
        Mars has been explored by unmanned spacecraft. Mariner 4, launched by NASA on November 28, 1964, was the first
        spacecraft to visit Mars, making its closest approach to the planet on July 15, 1965. Mariner 4 detected the weak
        Martian radiation belt, measured at about 0.1% that of Earth and captured the first images of another planet from deep
        space.[23][24] On July 20, 1976, Viking 1 performed the first successful landing on the Martian surface.[25] The Soviet
        Mars 3 spacecraft achieved a soft landing in December 1971 but contact was lost with its lander seconds after
        touchdown.[26] On July 4, 1997, the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars and on July 5 released its rover,
        Sojourner, the first robotic rover to operate on Mars.[27] Pathfinder was followed by the Mars Exploration Rovers,
        Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in January 2004 and operated until March 22, 2010 and June 10, 2018,
        respectively.[28][29] The Mars Express orbiter, the first European Space Agency spacecraft to visit Mars, arrived in
        orbit on December 25, 2003.[30] On September 24, 2014, the Indian Space Research Organization became the fourth space
        agency to visit Mars, when its maiden interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft, arrived in
        orbit.[31][32]
        
        There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life.
        Astrobiology missions are planned, including the Perseverance and Rosalind Franklin rovers.[33][34][35][36] Liquid water
        cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure
        on Earth, except at the lowest elevations for short periods.[37][38][39] The two polar ice caps appear to be made
        largely of water.[40][41] The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover
        the planetary surface to a depth of 11 meters (36 ft).[42] In November 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of
        underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the
        volume of water in Lake Superior.[43][44][45]
        
        Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches
        −2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.[12] Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited
        to resolving features about 300 kilometers (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's
        atmosphere.[46]
